# Low-Cost Vital Monitoring Device for Infants

## Overview
This experimental thesis focuses on the design, implementation, and testing of a low-cost device intended for monitoring the vital functions of the wearer. The idea behind this device was conceived to offer parents greater control over their infants during the first year of life, with the aim of preventing unexpected deaths such as:

- Accidental suffocation,
- Positional asphyxia,
- Choking due to inhalation or regurgitation,
- And unexplained incidents like Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

In these cases, immediate detection of danger is critical to saving the infant's life and avoiding permanent brain damage.

Although the percentage of such deaths is fortunately very low, it is essential that parents have access to an affordable and highly reliable embedded system.

## Scope of the Thesis
This thesis will analyze the various stages involved in the development of the device, including:

- Conceptualization and design,
- Selection and application of sensors,
- Preliminary testing,
- Final experimentation.

The entire process is described from an engineering perspective, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the project's development.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this work is to create a cost-effective and dependable system that allows real-time monitoring of an infantâ€™s vital signs, contributing to the reduction of preventable infant deaths. The approach combines careful sensor selection and system design to ensure both practicality and efficiency.
